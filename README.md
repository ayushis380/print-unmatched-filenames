# print-unmatched-filenames
This project helps in printing the similar and different filenames by comparing the filenames present at two different locations/paths. It generates a text file which contains two different sections. One section lists the filenames which are similar at both the locations. Second section lists the filenames which are dissimilar at both the locations.

We need to give three inputs as given below:

  1. Path of the first loaction.
  2. Path of the second location.
  3. The path where you want to generate the final text file.

It is useful in scenarios where we want to compare the filenames present at two different locations.
